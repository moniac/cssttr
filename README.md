# Progress

This week I spent a lot of time experimenting with CSS Grid, it's an exciting new layout technology that enables you to make very nice layouts without any weird CSS hacks!

Unfortunately, this meant I also spent a lot of time on this and not on actually properly designing.

So for next week, probably starting this weekend, I'd like to remake the website from scratch and focus on accessibility right away.
