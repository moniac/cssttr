# Progress

# Week 1

This week I spent a lot of time experimenting with CSS Grid, it's an exciting new layout technology that enables you to make very nice layouts without any weird CSS hacks!

Unfortunately, this meant I also spent a lot of time on this and not on actually properly designing.

So for next week, probably starting this weekend, I'd like to remake the website from scratch and focus on accessibility right away.

# Week 2

This week I invested a lot of time into the other project, wafs. That and I spent some time helping others, which was nice but did eat into my time.

I had also chosen to remake the website, because I was unhappy with the lack of complexity in the previous design.

I wanted to make the website fun for Merijn, so it became a fanpage.

I invested a lot of time into getting the Tab Skip to content working, which I am very happy with.

# Week 3

In the final week, I tried to pull all the components together, to create a feeling of cohesion. As happy I am with the progress, I don't think I put in enough fancy details to make it a very pleasurable website, and will have to invest more time in the upcoming vacation.
